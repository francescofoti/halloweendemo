# halloweendemo

Halloweendemo is a VT100 application written in VBA leveraging the consoul.net library.

This is a simple demo which creates and animates pumpkin sprites that were drawn with [asciipaint](https://github.com/francescofoti/asciipaint).

The goal is to test the performance and limits (and problems) that may arise when creating, moving and interacting (you can click a pumpkin to kill it, if you catch it) multiple sprites (consoul windows).

You can read more about [the project on the consoul.net website docs (hallowwendemo page)](https://consoul.net/docs/demos/halloweendemo.htm)

Needs [the 32bits consoul dll](https://consoul.net/docs/downloads/) to function.
